## Development Methodology (Scrum)

This project follows the **Scrum framework**:

* **Product Backlog**: All system features and user stories stored as GitHub Issues
* **Sprint Backlog**: Selected backlog items committed for a specific sprint
* **Sprints**: Fixed-duration development cycles
* **Scrum Events**:

  * Sprint Planning
  * Daily Scrum
  * Sprint Review
  * Sprint Retrospective

GitHub Projects is used as a **Scrum board** to visualize progress. Although the board layout resembles Kanban, Scrum rules such as **fixed sprints, sprint goals, and scope locking** are strictly enforced.
